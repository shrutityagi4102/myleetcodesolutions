#Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time

"""Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.

The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].

Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive."""
